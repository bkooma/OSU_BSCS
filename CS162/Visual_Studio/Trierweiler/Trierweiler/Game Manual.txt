Some of the rooms have vampire gaurds. If you are caught by a gaurd the game
is over. You are safe when traveling around the rooms circumference. Doors
will remain open once you flip the switch regardless if you leave the room.

b) Treasure Room - Collect the treasure "T" to help you on your quest

------------------
|                |

dungeon key to unlock all locked doors. You can only collect a treasure once
